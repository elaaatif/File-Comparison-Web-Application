File Comparison Web Application  (File Distancing Problem)
Overview
This web application provides a user-friendly interface to compare text files using various similarity metrics. Users can upload two text files and choose from different calculation methods, such as Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance, Levenshtein Distance, TF-IDF Cosine Similarity, and TF-IDF Euclidean Distance. The application then displays the result of the selected calculation method along with an explanation and comparison for better interpretation.

Usage
Upload two text files using the file input fields on the home page.
Choose a calculation method from the available options (Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance, Levenshtein Distance, TF-IDF Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF Euclidean Distance).
Click the "Compare" button to see the similarity result.
View the result, explanation, and comparison on the results page.
Calculation Methods
Cosine Similarity
Cosine Similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a value between -1 (completely dissimilar) and 1 (completely similar). A cosine similarity result closer to 1 indicates high similarity, while a result closer to -1 indicates dissimilarity.

Euclidean Distance
Euclidean Distance measures the straight-line distance between two points in space. Smaller values indicate greater similarity.

Levenshtein Distance
Levenshtein Distance measures the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one word into the other. Smaller values indicate greater similarity.

TF-IDF Cosine Similarity
TF-IDF Cosine Similarity uses the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency metric to measure the similarity between two documents. A cosine similarity result closer to 1 indicates high similarity, while a result closer to -1 indicates dissimilarity.

TF-IDF Euclidean Distance
TF-IDF Euclidean Distance measures the Euclidean distance between the TF-IDF vectors of two documents. Smaller Euclidean distance values indicate greater similarity between the documents.

Additional Notes
The application automatically creates an "uploads" directory to store uploaded files temporarily.
Uploaded files are deleted after the comparison is complete.
